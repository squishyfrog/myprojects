		<h2>The Summer Resort of Your Dreams</h2>

		<p>Bora Bora (French: Bora-Bora; Tahitian: Pora Pora) is an island group in the Leeward Islands. The Leeward Islands comprise the western part of the Society Islands of French Polynesia, which is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in the Pacific Ocean. Bora Bora has a total land area of 30.55 km^2 (12 sq mi). The main island, located about 230 kilometres (143 miles) northwest of Papeete, is surrounded by a lagoon and a barrier reef. In the center of the island are the remnants of an extinct volcano, rising to two peaks, Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu; the highest point is at 727 metres (2,385 feet). Bora Bora is part of the Commune of Bora-Bora, which also includes the atoll of Tūpai. The languages spoken in Bora Bora are Tahitian and French. However, due to the high tourism population, many natives of Bora Bora have learned to speak English.</p>

		
		<p>Bora Bora is a major international tourist destination, famous for its seaside (and even offshore) luxury resorts. The major settlement, Vaitape, is on the western side of the main island, opposite the main channel leading into the lagoon. Produce of the island is mostly limited to what can be obtained from the sea and from the plentiful coconut trees, which were historically of economic importance for the production of copra.</p>

		<p>The island's economy is driven almost entirely by tourism. Several resorts have been built on the motu surrounding the lagoon. (Motu is a Tahitian word meaning “small islands.”) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Bora_Bora" target="_blank">Hotel Bora Bora</a> opened in 1961, and nine years later the first over-water bungalows on stilts over the lagoon was built. Today, over-water bungalows are a standard feature of most Bora Bora resorts. The bungalows range from relatively inexpensive basic accommodations to very luxurious expensive ones.</p>


		<p>Most of the tourist destinations are sea-oriented; however, there are also tourist attractions on land, such as World War II cannons. <a href="https://www.airtahiti.com/en/" target="_blank">Air Tahiti</a> operates five or six flights daily between Tahiti and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_Bora_Airport" target="_blank">Bora Bora Airport</a> on Motu Mute (as well as occasional flights to and from other islands). There is no public transport on the island, so rental cars and bicycles are the recommended means of transport. In addition, there are small, two-seater buggies for hire in Vaitape, and motorboats can be rented to explore the lagoon. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaitape" target="_blank">Vaitape</a> is a large city on the west side of the island and is home to a large part of the island’s population. The city has also become a popular spot for tourism.</p>

		<p>Snorkeling and scuba diving in and around Bora Bora’s lagoon are popular activities. Many species of sharks and rays inhabit the surrounding waters. A few dive operators on the island offer manta-ray dives and shark-feeding dives. (The species of shark living in the island's lagoon are not considered dangerous to people.)</p>
